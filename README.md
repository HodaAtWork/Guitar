# Guitar
---
The intention of this repository is to view the guitar from an angle other than what it's made for: playing music. I'd like to dive into some `why` and `how` questions that arise when playing the guitar. Guitar builders definitely know all about it but for me this is a more or less technical challenge. There are tons of information available on the internet. However I want to do the `math` myself. 

I confine myself to the traditional 6 string classical or Spanish guitar; so to say the descendants of the guitar models Torres and Hauser built at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Since then the model and size of the classical guitar essentially did not change much.

Subjects I'd like to dive into might be:
- location of frets on the fretboard
- string tension
- harmonics, both natural and artificial
- relations action, bridge and strings
